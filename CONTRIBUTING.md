## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please be respectful, inclusive, and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - A fast Python package installer and resolver
- Git installed and configured

## Development Setup

### Installing uv

If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it using [UV Getting Started](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub

2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/social-links.git
cd social-links
```

3. Add the upstream repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ysskrishna/social-links.git
```

4. Install the project and development dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
- Install the project in editable mode
- Install all development dependencies (including `pytest` and documentation tools)

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix-name
```

2. Make your changes following the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines

3. Write or update tests for your changes (see [Testing](#testing))

4. Ensure all tests pass and the code is properly formatted

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests using pytest:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Running Specific Test Files

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_core.py
uv run pytest tests/test_platforms.py
uv run pytest tests/test_platform_management.py
uv run pytest tests/test_edge_cases.py
```

### Running Specific Test Functions

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_core.py::test_function_name
```

### Test Coverage

Make sure your changes include appropriate test coverage. All new features should have corresponding tests.

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Follow the existing test file naming convention (`test_*.py`)
- Test both success cases and error cases
- Include edge cases when relevant

## Submitting Changes

1. **Update Documentation**: If you've added new features or changed behavior, update the relevant documentation:
   - Update `README.md` if the API or usage has changed
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a description of your changes
   - Update docstrings if you've modified functions

2. **Commit Your Changes**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you added"
```

Good commit messages:
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Be concise but descriptive
- Reference issue numbers if applicable (e.g., "Fix #123: description")

3. **Push to Your Fork**:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

4. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your fork and branch
   - Fill out the PR template with:
     - Description of changes
     - Related issues (if any)
     - Testing performed
     - Any breaking changes

5. **Respond to Feedback**: Be open to feedback and ready to make changes if requested

## Code Style

### General Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

### Type Hints

- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- The project includes a `py.typed` marker file, so type hints are important

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise docstrings
- Follow the existing docstring format in the codebase
- Include parameter descriptions and return value descriptions
- Add examples for complex functions

### Import Organization

- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local
- Use absolute imports
- Keep imports at the top of the file

## Building the Package

To build the package locally:

```bash
uv build
```

This will create distribution files in the `dist/` directory:
- `social-links-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel)
- `social-links-<version>.tar.gz` (source distribution)

### Installing the Local Package

To test the package installation locally:

```bash
# Install from the built wheel
uv pip install dist/social-links-*.whl

# Or install in editable mode for development
uv pip install -e .
```

## Documentation

This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) for documentation.

### Serving Documentation Locally

To preview the documentation locally with live reload:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local development server (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) that automatically reloads when you make changes to the documentation files.

### Building Documentation

To build the documentation as static HTML files:

```bash
uv run mkdocs build
```

This will create a `site/` directory containing the static HTML files ready for deployment.
